# OptimizingForTrafficFlowEquiilibrium
A study of Franke-Wolfe Algorithm and Method of Successive Averages for finding equilibrium traffic flows on networks.

This repository contains the Python scripts to implement Frank-Wolfe and MSA algorithms to obtain user equilibrium link traffic flows on transportation networks. A detailed project report is included for reference.
